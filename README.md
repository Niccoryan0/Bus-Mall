# Bus-Mall

This is an app wherein a user clicks through a series of images, selecting their favorite from a random assortment of images in the Bus-mall catalogue. After a set number of clicks, the user will be presented with two graphs, one displaying the number of times each image was shown and the number of times it was clicked in a stacked bar chart, the other being the same info displayed as a percentage of times clicked to times shown, to visualize the data in a different way. The page uses local storage to keep track of the results from each click, so at any point the user can leave and reenter or refresh the page and their number of clicks and times shown for each image will be saved. A button was added to clear local storage and refresh the page should the user want to start with a clean slate.
